# PCA-and-Clustering-on-simulated-gene-expression-data

I implemented PCA on simulated gene expression data and then performed Clustering.
The simulation was such that, the observations belong to different classes. 
It was seen that first two principal components well describe variability in data.
When we perform Clustering using two principal components, we get accurate results.
Thus we have successfully reduced dimensions without much loss of information.
